generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The original Accord Hybrid was based on the seventh-generation Accord and took an unusual approach to hybrid technology, focusing on performance rather than maximum fuel economy. It paired a 3.0L V6 engine with an electric motor for a combined 255 HP, making it more powerful than the standard V6 model. Using Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system, it featured a relatively small battery pack and could not operate in electric-only mode for extended periods. The exterior was distinguished by subtle hybrid badging, unique wheels, and a small rear spoiler. The interior was largely identical to high-end Accord models with leather seating and premium features as standard. While it delivered better fuel economy than the conventional V6 Accord, the modest improvement (around 25% better) and high price premium limited its appeal. This generation represented Honda's first attempt at a hybrid mid-size sedan, but its performance-oriented approach contrasted with competitors like the Toyota Camry Hybrid that prioritized efficiency."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2015
    description: "After a six-year hiatus, the Accord Hybrid returned based on the ninth-generation Accord with a completely different approach. This time focusing on efficiency, it featured Honda's new two-motor hybrid system combining a 2.0L Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with two electric motors for a combined 196 HP. Unlike the previous IMA system, this more sophisticated setup allowed for extended electric-only driving and three distinct operating modes. Exterior differences were again subtle, with unique blue-accented grille and lights, aerodynamic wheels, and hybrid badging. The interior featured special hybrid displays and instrumentation while maintaining the comfort and quality of standard Accord models. Fuel economy was dramatically improved to an EPA-rated 50 mpg city, 45 mpg highway, making it among the most efficient mid-size sedans of its time. This generation established a more successful formula for the Accord Hybrid, though production constraints limited its availability."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2022
    description: "Based on the tenth-generation Accord, this iteration refined the two-motor hybrid system with a more compact design and improved power delivery. The 2.0L Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine and dual electric motors produced a combined 212 HP while delivering excellent efficiency. Exterior styling was largely identical to conventional Accord models aside from hybrid badging and unique wheel designs. The interior featured the tenth-generation Accord's upscale design with hybrid-specific displays and instrumentation to monitor power flow and efficiency. Initially available in multiple trim levels from base to Touring, it offered varying levels of luxury and technology while maintaining the same hybrid powertrain. A refresh in 2021 brought updated styling, improved hybrid system refinement, and enhanced technology. This generation successfully integrated the hybrid powertrain into the critically acclaimed tenth-generation Accord platform, offering an efficient alternative without compromising the sedan's driving dynamics or practicality."

  - name: "Fourth Generation"
    start_year: 2023
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Accord Hybrid is based on the eleventh-generation Accord and features the fourth generation of Honda's two-motor hybrid system. Now positioned as the upper half of the Accord lineup rather than a separate model, it pairs a 2.0L Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with upgraded electric motors for a combined 204 HP. The system is more responsive and refined than its predecessor, with smoother transitions between power sources. Exterior styling is identical to non-hybrid eleventh-generation Accords except for hybrid badging. The interior features the same horizontal dashboard design with a standard 10.2-inch digital instrument display and available 12.3-inch touchscreen, plus hybrid-specific information displays. Available in Sport, Sport-L, EX-L, and Touring trims, the hybrid now represents the premium end of the Accord range with more features and technology than the base 1.5L turbocharged models. This generation emphasizes the hybrid powertrain's refinement and performance benefits alongside its efficiency, positioning it as the preferred choice rather than merely an alternative, reflecting Honda's increased focus on electrification across its lineup."
